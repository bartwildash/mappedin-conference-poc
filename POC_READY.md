## 🎬 2-Minute Demo Script

### **Intro** (10 seconds)
> "This is our 3D interactive venue map POC. Let me show you..."

### **Feature 1: Booth Discovery** (30 seconds)
> "The map shows all exhibitor booths. Let me click one..."
>
> *[Click any booth marker]*
>
> "Instant card with company details, categories, contact info. Notice how smooth that was? Zero API calls—all data is preloaded and cached."

### **Feature 2: Smart Search** (30 seconds)
> "Or search by name..."
>
> *[Type "Boeing" in search]*
>
> "Real-time results as I type. Click..."
>
> *[Click result]*
>
> "Camera flies to booth, card appears. Works for booth numbers too."

### **Feature 3: Drop Pin** (30 seconds)
> "We've added some fun details. Watch this parachute drop pin..."
>
> *[Click 🪂 button, then click map]*
>
> "See the animation? Falls, bounces, lands. This can be used for custom navigation start points in v1.0."

### **Feature 4: Blue Dot** (20 seconds)
> "And user positioning with Mappedin's official BlueDot..."
>
> *[Click 📍 button]*
>
> "Real-time user location for live wayfinding."

### **Closing** (10 seconds)
> "Fast, polished, production-ready architecture. The full roadmap adds navigation, multi-floor, and analytics. Ready to proceed?"
