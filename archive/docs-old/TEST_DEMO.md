## 🐛 Known Limitations (POC)

### Expected Behaviors:

**1. Exhibitor Data**
- Currently tries to fetch from API
- If API not accessible, uses cached data
- If no cache, shows "No exhibitor data available"
- **This is OK for POC demo!**

**2. Blue Dot Location**
- May not be accurate without GPS
- Falls back to IP geolocation or map center
- **For demo: Just show the feature works**

**3. No Wayfinding Yet**
- Drop pin doesn't start navigation (v1.0 feature)
- Blue dot doesn't show routing (v1.0 feature)
- **POC focuses on discovery, not navigation**

## 🎬 Demo Script (60 seconds)

**Use this when demoing to stakeholders:**

### Opening (5 seconds)

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

**Expected on modern hardware:**

| Metric | Target | Typical |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Map load | < 3s | 1-2s |
| Exhibitor fetch | < 500ms | 200ms |
| Click response | < 100ms | 50ms |
| Search results | < 100ms | 20ms |
| Animation FPS | 60fps | 60fps |

**Test on:**
- ✅ Chrome (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ⚠️ Firefox (may be slower)
- ⚠️ Mobile (use responsive view in devtools)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Map Doesn't Load
**Check:**
1. Internet connection (Mappedin SDK loads from CDN)
2. Browser console for errors (F12)
3. Mappedin credentials are correct

**Fix:**
- Refresh page
- Clear cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Try different browser

### No Exhibitor Markers
**Reason:** API not accessible or CORS issue

**Expected for POC:**
- Map still loads
- Can still test blue dot & drop pin
- Just no exhibitor data

**For demo:**
- Use cached data (works offline!)
- Or mock the API (see below)

### Blue Dot Permission Denied
**Reason:** Browser blocked location access

**Fix:**
- Click lock icon in address bar
- Allow location permission
- Refresh page

**Alternative:**
- Demo works without it
- Just explain: "Would show user location here"
