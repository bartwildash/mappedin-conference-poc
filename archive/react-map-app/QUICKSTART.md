# 🚀 Quick Start - React Map App

## ✅ Ready to Run!

Your React version of the Mappedin conference map is ready. Here's how to start:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd react-map-app
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at **http://localhost:3000** 🎉

### 3. Test Features

✅ **Search** - Type in the search bar to find locations
✅ **Click Booths** - Click any space to see exhibitor info
✅ **Navigate** - Click "Directions" to get turn-by-turn routing
✅ **Accessible Mode** - Toggle for elevator-preferred routes

### 📦 What's Included

```
✅ All essential files created
✅ TypeScript configuration ready
✅ Vite build setup complete
✅ All components with CSS
✅ Mock exhibitor data
✅ Full documentation
```

### 🔧 Configuration

The app uses the same Mappedin credentials as your HTML version:

- **Key**: `mik_Qar1NBX1qFjtljLDI52a60753`
- **Secret**: `mis_CXFS9WnkQkzQmy9GCt4uOJx87hoWvQhXq170eEjauGKho2g74`
- **Map ID**: `66ce20fdf42a3e000b1b0545`

### ⚠️ Important Note

The React SDK package names in `package.json` are:
- `@mappedin/mappedin-js` - Core SDK (same as HTML version)
- `@mappedin/react-sdk` - React wrapper

**Note:** The actual package for React might be different. If `@mappedin/react-sdk` doesn't exist, you may need to use the web SDK directly with React or check Mappedin's latest documentation.

### 🔄 Alternative: Use Web SDK in React

If the React SDK package isn't available, the components are already structured to work with the vanilla web SDK:

```typescript
import { getMapData, showVenue } from '@mappedin/mappedin-js';
```

Just adapt the `useMap()` hook usage to direct SDK calls.

### 📝 Next Steps

1. ✅ Install packages
2. ✅ Run dev server
3. 🔄 Test in browser
4. 🔄 Replace mock data with real API
5. 🔄 Deploy to production

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Package not found?**
- Check Mappedin documentation for latest package names
- Use `@mappedin/mappedin-js` directly with React patterns

**TypeScript errors?**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all types are installed
- Check `tsconfig.json` settings

**Map not loading?**
- Verify Mappedin credentials
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure internet connection (SDK loads from CDN)
