## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Source map warning** (Harmless)
   - Mappedin SDK missing source map for CSS
   - Does not affect functionality
   - Only visible in browser console

2. **"oneway" image warning** (Cosmetic)
   - Mappedin SDK internal image reference
   - Does not affect map display or navigation
   - Can be safely ignored

### Expected Behaviors
- **Search requires 2+ characters** - This is intentional for performance
- **Navigation requires both start and end** - Standard UX pattern
- **Some spaces don't have exhibitor data** - This is normal (hallways, restrooms, etc.)

---

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Map Load Time**: ~1-2 seconds
- **Search Response**: ~200-300ms (debounced)
- **Navigation Calculation**: ~500ms-1s (Mappedin API)
- **Smooth 60fps** camera transitions
- **Optimized marker rendering** (zoom-based)

---

  key: 'mik_YOUR_KEY',                // Your Mappedin key
  secret: 'mis_YOUR_SECRET'           // Your Mappedin secret
});
```
