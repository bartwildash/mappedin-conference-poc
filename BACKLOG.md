## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Decision:** Use "fetch all" instead of individual queries
  - **Rationale:** 1 request vs 500, better performance
  - **Trade-off:** Higher initial load, but instant clicks
  - **Date:** 2025-01-09

- **Decision:** WebView instead of native Mappedin SDK
  - **Rationale:** Single codebase, easier updates
  - **Trade-off:** Slightly less performant than native
  - **Date:** 2025-01-09

### Feature Decisions
- **Deferred:** Turn-by-turn navigation to v1.0
  - **Rationale:** POC focuses on discovery, not wayfinding
  - **Date:** 2025-01-09

- **Deferred:** Multi-floor support to v1.0
  - **Rationale:** Single floor sufficient for POC demo
  - **Date:** 2025-01-09
